## Note Block Radio
A mod that allows you to broadcast note block songs across your Minecraft world.
### Features
- **Radio**: Plays music transmitted by nearby transmitters.
- **Transmitter**: Transmits music played by nearby note blocks when powered.
- **Minecart with Transmitter**: Same thing as the transmitter, just in a minecart. Activate it with an activator rail. Great for long note block songs!
- **Radio Jammer**: Used for trolling. Just transmits a random note every tick when powered.
- **Relay**: Relays notes on a specific channel when powered.

Anything with a channel (transmitters, radios, etc.) can have its channel changed by shift+right-clicking it.
### Config
- **Lossless Range**: The range at which a transmission is received the same as it was sent. (Default 128)
- **Lossy Range**: The range added onto the lossless range at which a transmission is received, but some notes may be lost. (Default 64)
- **Channel Count**: The amount of channels available to select from. (Default 16)
- **Relay Hop Limit**: The maximum amount of relays a signal can hop between to reach a radio. (Default 8)
